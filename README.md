# Customer_Purchase_Behaviour_Dashboard
This project shows the excel sheet and dashboard that I created for a 10Alytics project. It was created to understand customers' purchase behavior, using KPIs (such as regions, age bracket and promotions) by conducting thorough data analysis and gaining insights to help the organization make transformative business decisions.
